            "content": "Attempted to get through a horror movie together and he kept letting the movie run then rewinding the movie so that the \u201chorror\u201d never came. He pretended to be scared and would whine about the \u201cscare\u201d that was coming. I guess he thought this was a cute gesture, and would refused to continue. It dragged a 5 mins scene into a 45 min production of his \u201coh no but I\u2019m scared, nooo I don\u2019t want to... this is terrifying\u201d.\n\nThis was a guy who told me that he LOVED horror movies. He was full of really weird contradictions, but this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\n**EDIT**: Holy cow, this really blew up! Thanks for confirming I'm not insane for being annoyed with his actions. Thanks for the comments - a lot of them were hilarious! There were a lot of questions, so I'll try to answer some of them:\n\n*What was the movie?* \n\nIt was an older J-horror movie called Kuchisake-Onna. I think the English title was something like the Carved Mouth Woman. \n\n*You mentioned he fast-forwarded, do you mean rewound?* \n\nNope, I do mean fast-forwarded. He would rewind, then fast forward to get to the beginning of the scene and then pause it and whine about how it was going to be scary. He would also study the paused scene and look at clues to determine what the \"scare\" was going to be. \n\n*Did you comfort/hug him?* \n\nIt was maybe the second time we'd hung out together, so even though I was interested in him, it was too early to say we were \"dating\" and I was pretty shy and kind of reserved, so no hugging would have happened even IF it all had gone well. \n\n*What were you doing during the 45 mins?*\n\nI remember thinking \"is he for real?\" then thought that somehow maybe he was trying to tease me (he's a man of a lot of contradictions).  So I played along for a while. By the time 15 minutes passed, I'm sure I was sighing audibly. I suggested that we stop and maybe watch something else. He refused. Close to the 30 minute mark I think I snapped and said words to the effect of \"come on, it's probably not that bad - let's just finish go through it and continue the movie. don't waste time\". He laughed and kept up the one-man show of \"I'm a sensitive man and I'm not afraid to show it\". I gave up and just started looking through my phone because this was such a waste of time - and finally I think he realised he'd gone too far and let the scene play out. \n\n*Did you end up finishing the movie?*\n\nNope because he tried the same thing at the next scary part and I made my excuses and got out of there. \n\n*Was he a child*?\n\nNope, fully grown male of legal age. \n\n*Why didn't you just stabby stab him?*\n\nI considered it but I wasn't carrying my Dexter kill room equipment and the blood would have been too messy. Just kidding. He was tall and I'm pretty short. Probably wouldn't have ended well for me.\n\n*Did you let him know why you didn't want to see him again?*\n\nNope, I never told him that this was the defining moment in which I lost interest. He was also kind of controlling and had a number of really weird quirks that I won't bore my fellow redditors with. Basically we just didn't talk as much after that and that was that.",
