When it does it releases a small disc that allows water to flow.

Because it doesn\u2019t take long to pass out from the smoke, people tend to do so while trying to escape. Don\u2019t waste your time searching for your animals.

I can also give my opinions, but they are mine and not every firefighter\u2019s. \n\nFirst, we put more emphasis on saving people than pets. I know that probably isn\u2019t the most popular assertion on Reddit, but it\u2019s true. In addition, we will risk less to save a pet. I don\u2019t want to inform a spouse that their spouse died saving a cat. Again, not popular but this is reality. We do primary and secondary searches in every structure fire and if we find a pet, we will definitely pull them out. The big issue is that pets run and hide when frightened. Most pets I\u2019ve found were in a closet or under a bed. Having said all that, here are my ideas:\n\nFire prevention - if you don\u2019t have a fire, your pet will not be in jeopardy. Working smoke alarms (with working batteries and tested once a month) combustibles away from open flame, extension cords used temporarily and not permanently, flammable liquids stored safely, electrical system up to code, etc. Research fire safety and put into practice. \n\nFire escape plan - create one and practice it with you family, and include pets in it. Assembling everyone in a meeting place, including pets, will ensure everyone is out. While we\u2019re at it, include house guests too. Many people forget this. \n\nTell the responding fire department there is a pet in the house. They will be on the lookout, with the caveats mentioned above. \n\nSee if your local FD has pet masks on their trucks. My department does. We just had another successful pet save a few days ago, and the cat is doing fine. It\u2019s also great media for the department, so it may be an easy sell, if you wish to encourage them. Some of our pet masks were donated by citizens. \n\nI hope this helps. The best chance of survival is not to have a fire in the first place. Make your homes fire safe! \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude92 \ud83d\ude92 \ud83d\udd25\n\n*Added*. A lot of questions about extension cords. When I gave my advice, I\u2019m going by the legislation for my area (Ontario, Canada). Please go by legislation for your area. I realize there are many instances where an extension cord, especially a surge protected power bar, is warranted. Sorry for the confusion. \n\nAlso many questions about specific pets. We will do our best to get your pet out safe. When we fight a fire, we prop open doors and if the fire is severe enough, take some windows as well. When this happens, pets sometimes \u201cself rescue.\u201d",

We will always do our best to save any living thing in a fire, but your pet sadly will never be a priority to save in an active firefight. We are looking for humans, if we find a pet, we will 100% grab them and bring them out. All of our apparatus with my agency have pet masks that I\u2019ve used a few times. \n\nAs far as tips or tricks, maybe train your pet to run to the front door when the smoke alarm goes off. I imagine this would be easiest with large mammals like cats and dogs. Those window stickers are a fine idea, but not ever in the forefront of our minds as we approach a working fire. Letting us know where your pet likely is. What your pet is. And please, for the sake of OUR families, don\u2019t send me into your fully engulfed house to find your \u201cbaby\u201d that is actually a cat or a dog. One of the scariest close calls I\u2019ve ever had was going back into a fully engulfed single wide mobile home that my partner and I ended up falling through the floor of while searching for the homeowners \u201cbaby\u201d. When we finally got out we were heartbroken and devastated we couldn\u2019t find the baby only to see the homeowner holding a small dog saying her baby had made it out. She was willing to sacrifice our lives for her dog, and that\u2019s just not okay. As a rule now I make sure to find out if the baby is a human or not before I go inside or send my guys inside.\n\nEdit to add- as I stated to a commenter further down, maybe teaching your animal to be as vocal as possible at the sight/smell of smoke would be another helpful thing for us to find them. Animals like to hide making them hard to see, but a dog barking like crazy or a bird screaming(that\u2019s actually how I found the two parrots I saved) will help us. Not sure how well that can be trained though.",

More often than not, they are incredibly aware of the house layout, but can easily become disoriented or panicked in a fire. \n\nThe best \u201ctips\u201d are sometimes the exact things we stress to other humans:\n\n1. Keep doors closed and rooms isolated, this can keep heat, smoke and fire from other rooms. \n\n2. Keep your house less cluttered and never block potential entries or exits.\n\n3. Lastly (and I cannot stress this enough), never enter the home again or attempt to find your animal. Let us go inside and get them for you. Many people believe they can save their animal, and don\u2019t come back out. We can get in, knock the fire down, and potentially save your animal without the risk of you dying.",
